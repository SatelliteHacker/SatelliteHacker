<br>Hi, I’m @SatelliteHacker
<br>I have a day job fixing terrestrial and satellite transmitters.
<br>I’m interested in TV, video, transmitter, satellite, and coding technologies.
<br>I code in C on Debian....using tmux and ed
<br>I write my own front and back end (Ok... I cheat and use HTML for the front end - because CGI scripting in C is challenging). 
<br>Occasionally I dabble in other languages.
<br>I’m currently learning EVERYTHING
<br>I’m working on a project using a Raspi for control of satellite dishes, receivers, encoders, upconverters, and other transmission equipment (among other projects)
<br>OF COURSE I own a bona-fide spectrum analyzer (and o'scope, etc)... 
<br>I can be reached - at various transmitter sites around Cedar Hill, TX
